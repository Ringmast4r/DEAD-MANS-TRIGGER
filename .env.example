# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# 1. Sign up for SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
#    https://signup.sendgrid.com/

# 2. Create API Key
#    - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys
#    - Click "Create API Key"
#    - Choose "Full Access"
#    - Copy the key and paste it above as SENDGRID_API_KEY

# 3. Authenticate Your Domain (CRITICAL for email delivery)
#    - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
#    - Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
#    - Follow DNS setup instructions
#    - Use authenticated domain in SENDER_EMAIL (e.g., alerts@yourdomain.com)

# 4. Why Domain Authentication Matters:
#    - Without it, emails may be silently dropped by Gmail/Outlook
#    - Proves you own the domain you're sending from
#    - Adds SPF, DKIM, DMARC records to your DNS

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ALTERNATIVE: Use Verified Single Sender (Testing Only)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# For testing purposes only, you can verify a single email:
# - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth/senders
# - Click "Create New Sender"
# - Verify your email
# - Use that email as SENDER_EMAIL

# WARNING: Single sender verification has limitations
# For production use, always authenticate your domain!
