🎯 HOW TO USE (SUPER SIMPLE - NO SETUP REQUIRED!)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This dead man's trigger automatically releases information if you
fail to check in within your specified timeframe.

NO TECHNICAL SKILLS REQUIRED. ZERO SETUP. JUST WORKS.


STEP 1: OPEN THE PAGE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Double-click index.html to open in your browser
2. Click "SETUP TRIGGER"


STEP 2: CONFIGURE YOUR TRIGGER (ONE TIME ONLY)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Fill in what you want to happen:

⏱ Timer Duration (hours)
   • How often you need to check in
   • Example: 24 = check in once per day
   • Example: 0.5 = check in every 30 minutes

📧 Email Recipients (optional)
   • Enter email addresses (comma separated)
   • Example: john@example.com, jane@example.com
   • When triggered: Opens pre-filled emails - you just click send

📄 Secret Message (optional)
   • Type your confidential information
   • When triggered: Auto-downloads as text file

📎 Upload File (optional)
   • Click to upload any file (<2MB)
   • When triggered: Auto-downloads the file

🔗 URLs to Open (optional)
   • Paste URLs (one per line)
   • When triggered: Auto-opens all URLs


STEP 3: ARM THE TRIGGER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Click "ARM TRIGGER"
2. Done! The countdown begins.


STEP 4: CHECK IN REGULARLY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
• Keep the page open (or reopen it)
• Click "CHECK-IN / RESET" before timer expires
• This proves you're alive and resets the countdown


WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T CHECK IN?
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
When the timer hits zero, ALL configured actions happen automatically:

✓ Files download to your computer
✓ Secret message downloads as text file
✓ Email client opens with pre-filled messages (ready to send)
✓ URLs open in new tabs

Everything is AUTOMATIC except emails (you just click "Send").


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TESTING IT OUT (RECOMMENDED!)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Want to see it work without waiting hours?

1. Set timer to 0.01 hours (that's 36 seconds)
2. Add your own email as recipient
3. Type a test message like "This is a test"
4. Click "ARM TRIGGER"
5. Wait 36 seconds
6. Watch it trigger!

You'll see:
• Message downloads as text file
• Email client opens with pre-filled message
• You just click "Send" and you'll receive it!

FAQ
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Q: Is my data secure?
A: It's stored locally on your computer in browser storage. Anyone with
   access to your computer could potentially view it. Don't store highly
   sensitive data without additional encryption.

Q: Can I have multiple triggers?
A: Not currently. You can only have one trigger configured at a time.

Q: Will this work if my computer is off?
A: No. The timer runs in your browser. If browser is closed, timer pauses
   until you reopen the page.

Q: Can I use this for serious/critical situations?
A: This is a fun/educational tool. For real critical situations, use
   professional dead man's switch services with server-side triggers.

Q: How do I delete everything?
A: Click "DISARM & EDIT", then clear your browser data, or just delete
   the index.html file.
