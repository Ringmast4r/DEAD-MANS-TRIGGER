## Quick Checklist Before Committing

- [ ] Commit message is clear and descriptive
- [ ] NO emojis in commit message
- [ ] NO attribution footers
- [ ] NO co-authorship tags
- [ ] Author is ringmast4r only

## Why This Matters

The git history must show ONLY the project author (ringmast4r). Any external tooling, assistance, or automation methods should NOT be disclosed in public commit history.

This is non-negotiable for this project.
